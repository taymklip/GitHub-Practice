# Week 1: Predictive Modeling & Processes
- Gained an understanding of predictive modeling workflows, including defining problem statements and data requirements.
- Learned the importance of data preprocessing in improving model performance.

# Week 2: Data Exploration
- Explored techniques like univariate and bivariate analysis to summarize data distributions.
- Discovered the role of data visualization tools like `ggplot2` in understanding patterns and anomalies.

# Week 3: Linear Regression
- Learned how to implement simple and multiple linear regression models.
- Studied assumptions of linear regression, including linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality.

# Week 4: Classification
- Explored classification algorithms, such as logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors.
- Learned performance evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

# Week 5: Generalized Linear Models
- Studied extensions of linear models for non-normal response variables.
- Implemented logistic regression and Poisson regression using `glm()` in R.

# Week 6: Tree-Based Models
- Learned how to build and interpret decision trees.
- Explored ensemble methods like random forests and boosting for improved predictive accuracy.

# Week 7: Unsupervised Methods
- Applied clustering techniques, including K-Means and hierarchical clustering.
- Understood dimensionality reduction methods, such as PCA, for high-dimensional datasets.
